# ASCII_Art✔
### Ascii Art created only with PIL(Pillow) &amp; with minimal code. Includes optional image enhancer.

A program encasing minimal code to convert an image (or a collection of images, or a folder full of images) to ASCII Art and display it on your terminal. Or.... you could also convert and store the ASCII Art on a text file (code included for it). The program uses only [PIL (Pillow)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to perform the art, and ofcourse [sys module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) for the folder containing images to be converted to beautiful art. I have also included and optional [Image Enhancer/ Image Filter](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/Image%20Enhancer) for your use.

# Usage✔

Clone or Fork this repo. Navigate into the [ASCII Art Folder](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/ASCII%20Art). Then open your Terminal/CLI/Commad prompt and type in:- 
``` bash
python3 ascii_art.py filtered_images/
```
You can also take a glimpse into how the output is going to look like [here](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/blob/main/Sample_NASA_asciiart.txt). 

There are two different ascii art generators that you can use. The difference of the outputs generated might just have a slight difference.

You might first want to adjust and filter the images before converting them to ascii art. For this you can use the [Image Enhancer](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/Image%20Enhancer). To use the image enhancer program, navigate into the [Image Enhancer](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/Image%20Enhancer) folder. Then open your Terminal/CLI/Commad prompt and type in:- 
``` bash
python3 image_filter.py images/
```

# Contributions✔

Before contributing, first take a look at the 2 image to ascii convertor scripts [here](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/ASCII%20Art). You can make changes to any of the two files in any way you please while keeping in mind not to change the public version(coming out soon!).

You can contribute to this repository in any way, it could be simple thing. Maybe you want the user to input multiple images and have all the converted ascii images stored as different text files. You can also contribute by helping to write the [wiki](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/wiki) for this project. The options are endless. But, don't forget to mention me while making a pull request.
