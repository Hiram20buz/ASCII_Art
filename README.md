# ASCII_Artâœ”
### Ascii Art created only with PIL(Pillow) &amp; with minimal code. Includes optional image enhancer.

A program encasing minimal code to convert an image (or a collection of images, or a folder full of images) to ASCII Art and display it on your terminal. Or.... you could also convert and store the ASCII Art on a text file (code included for it). The program uses only [PIL (Pillow)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to perform the art, and ofcourse [sys module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) for the folder containing images to be converted to beautiful art. I have also included and optional [Image Enhancer/ Image Filter](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/Image%20Enhancer) for your use.

## Usage

Clone or Fork this repo. Navigate into the [ASCII Art Folder](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/ASCII%20Art). Then open your Terminal/CLI/Commad prompt and type in:- 
``` bash
python3 ascii_art.py filtered_images/
```
You can also take a glimpse into how the output is going to look like [here](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/blob/main/Sample_NASA_asciiart.txt).

To use the image filter program, navigate into the [Image Enhancer](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/Image%20Enhancer) folder. Then open your Terminal/CLI/Commad prompt and type in:- 
``` bash
python3 image_filter.py images/
```

## Contribution

You can contribute in any way you want here. You can create a program to remove the background from all the images and then convert them to ASCII, or you can create a code to create a colorised ASCII ART. There is no limit, you can contribute in any way.
