# Contributions

Before contributing, first take a look at the 2 image to ascii convertor scripts [here](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/tree/main/ASCII%20Art). You can make changes to any of the two files in any way you please while keeping in mind not to change the public version(coming out soon!).

You can contribute to this repository in any way, it could be simple thing. Maybe you want the user to input multiple images and have all the converted ascii images stored as different text files. You can also contribute by helping to write the [wiki](https://github.com/adrinorosario/ASCII_Art/wiki) for this project. The options are endless. But, don't forget to mention me while making a pull request.
